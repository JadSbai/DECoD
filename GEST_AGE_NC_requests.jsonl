A linear regression model fitting BIRTH_WEIGHT_NC to predict GEST_AGE_NC has a slope of 0.00 and an intercept of 33.36. \n\n- Statistical analysis for GEST_AGE_NC across categories of BIRTH_ORDER_NC:\nCategory 1:\n- Proportion (w.r.t total): 0.99 \n- Mean: 39.04\n- Standard Deviation: 2.17\n- Median: 39.00\nCategory 2:\n- Proportion (w.r.t total): 0.01 \n- Mean: 34.57\n- Standard Deviation: 2.34\n- Median: 35.00\n\nBinned statistics for GEST_AGE_NC across categories of BIRTH_ORDER_NC: \n\n\n        - Note: When analyzing these insights, consider the proportion with respect to the total as an important factor before drawing conclusions.\n        \n        ### Statistical Insights for the Subpopulations this patient belongs to:\n        None \n\n        \n\n\n        ### Known Correlations:\n        None\n\n        ### Task:\n        1. Review and analyze the provided insights. Reflect on how each insight might influence GEST_AGE_NC, taking into account the proportion of each category.\n        2. Identify significant correlations from the insights and the known correlations. Assess whether these correlations apply to the specific case given the entire context of the patient's data.\n        3. Construct a concise and succinct logical reasoning for the given value of GEST_AGE_NC, utilizing the specific values from the patient record, the deduced correlations, and the known correlations.\n        4. Do not openly assume in your reasoning any knowledge of the true value of the target variable.\n        5. Report concisely your output inside a JSON object with the following format:\n        \n        ### Expected Output Format:\n        {\n          \"value\": 38.0,\n          \"reasoning\": \"Based on [detailed logical steps that lead to the conclusion, using the patient data and insights].\",\n        }\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 300, "temperature": 0.2, "n": 1, "seed": 0}}
